## HTTP Required Reading

HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how documents are
transferred from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format
of the messages passed between *clients* and *servers*.

"Clients" send *requests* and receive *responses*. Examples include browsers
(like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and other programs like
[`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and
[`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

"Servers" receive requests and send responses. Examples are more complex, since
there are different kinds of servers. There are application servers, which work
in Node or Ruby to generate documents using those languages, and there are web
servers like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](http://nginx.com/), and
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net). The word "server" is also used to describe
the machine that these programs run on. In this document, the latter is what we
mean when we say "server", as in this diagram:

1.  A client sends a request to a server.
1.  The server processes the request.
1.  The response gets sent back to the client.
1.  The client processes the response.

## URLs

Which server is the request sent to? How does the server know what to respond
with? Both of these questions are answered by *uniform resource locator (URL)*.

From the url, the request is sent to the domain name within the url.  The path to
and file requested is also included in the url

Study each part of a URL using the [Mozilla Developer Network
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

## HTTP Verbs

A request has two parts: a URL and a verb. A request without both is incomplete.

By default, the browser issues GET requests when you type a URL into the address
bar and press `enter`. When you submit forms, the browser typically issues a
POST request.

## Make a Request

Make a request using the browser. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com). When
you clicked this link, the browser made a GET request to Google's server. We
often describe requests like this:

```txt
GET https://www.google.com/
```

If we know we're working with a particular server, we might abbreviate
it as follows. For example, if Google had API documentation that described
requests you could make to its server, that documentation might say instead:

```txt
GET /
```

In other words, API docs often only describe the URI instead of the full URL.

The response your browser receives from Google is an HTML document the browser
parses and renders. What would happen if you made the same GET request outside
of the browser?

Try this in your terminal:

```sh
curl --request GET https://www.google.com
```

What did you see?

looks like html from google page

## Responses & Resources

Servers send responses, and those responses contain resource representations.

Technically, the term "resource" refers to an abstraction that your application
uses; depending on what the application does, a resource might be a 'Car', a
'Person', a 'User', or an 'Order Cart'.

A single resource can be represented in multiple different ways by the server,
including HTML, JSON, PDF files, and images. What we really mean when we say
"resource" above is a specific representation of a resource.

You may think of resources as the documents that are returned (usually HTML or
JSON) as part of the response body.

## Questions

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Define HTTP

In your own words, give a brief description of what HTTP is.

```md
HTTP is the protocol used by the web and defines how messages are formatted and transmitted, and what actions Web servers and browsers should take in response to various commands.
```

## Describe what a client is and what a server is

 What is a client and what is a server? How do they interact with each other?

```md
a client is what sends a request out.  The server receives and processes the
request and creates a response.  this response is sent back to the client. the 2
interact using http protocol
```

## Describe the 4 most common HTTP verbs

What are the 4 most common HTTP verbs used when creating a RESTful API. How
would you use each?

```md
1. GET instructs the server to transmit the data identified by the URL to the client.
2. A PUT request is used when you wish to create or update the resource identified by the URL
3. DELETE should be used when you want to delete the resource identified by the URL of the request
4. POST is used when the processing you wish to happen on the server should be repeated.
```

## Describe what a Response is

What is a response? What does it contain? What are some common status codes in a
response and what do they mean?

```md
response is the answer to the request.

the response contains the status code of the request, header information and body
of the request.

200 OK
This response code indicates that the request was successful.

201 Created
This indicates the request was successful and a resource was created. It is used to confirm success of a PUT or POST request.

400 Bad Request
The request was malformed. This happens especially with POST and PUT requests, when the data does not pass validation, or is in the wrong format.

404 Not Found
This response indicates that the required resource could not be found. This is generally returned to all requests which point to a URL with no corresponding resource.

401 Unauthorized
This error indicates that you need to perform authentication before accessing the resource.

405 Method Not Allowed
The HTTP method used is not supported for this resource.

409 Conflict
This indicates a conflict. For instance, you are using a PUT request to create the same resource twice.

500 Internal Server Error
When all else fails; generally, a 500 response is used when processing fails due to unanticipated circumstances on the server side, which causes the server to error out.
```

## Make a curl request

Using curl, how would you get the content from Reddit.com?

```md
curl https://www.reddit.com
```

## Describe the parts of a URL

List the parts of a URL and explain what each part is, in your own words. You'll
refer to this list often in the next few weeks, so it's important to keep it in
an easy-to-reference place.

```md
http://www.example.com:80/path/to/myfile.html?key1=value1&key2=value2#SomewhereInTheDocument
1. http:// is the protocol. It indicates which protocol the browser must use
2. www.example.com is the domain name. It indicates which Web server is being requested
3. :80 is the port. It indicates the technical "gate" used to access the resources on the web server
4. /path/to/myfile.html is the path to the resource on the Web server
5. ?key1=value1&key2=value2 are extra parameters provided to the Web server. Those parameters are a list of key/value pairs separated with the & symbol. The Web server can use those parameters to do extra stuff before returning the resource.
6. #SomewhereInTheDocument is an anchor to another part of the resource itself. An anchor represents a sort of "bookmark" inside the resource, giving the browser the directions to show the content located at that "bookmarked" spot.
```
