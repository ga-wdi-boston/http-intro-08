## HTTP Required Reading

HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how documents are
transferred from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format
of the messages passed between *clients* and *servers*.

"Clients" send *requests* and receive *responses*. Examples include browsers
(like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and other programs like
[`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and
[`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

"Servers" receive requests and send responses. Examples are more complex, since
there are different kinds of servers. There are application servers, which work
in Node or Ruby to generate documents using those languages, and there are web
servers like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](http://nginx.com/), and
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net). The word "server" is also used to describe
the machine that these programs run on. In this document, the latter is what we
mean when we say "server", as in this diagram:

1.  A client sends a request to a server.
1.  The server processes the request.
1.  The response gets sent back to the client.
1.  The client processes the response.

## URLs

Which server is the request sent to? How does the server know what to respond
with? Both of these questions are answered by *uniform resource locator (URL)*.

Study each part of a URL using the [Mozilla Developer Network
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

## HTTP Verbs

A request has two parts: a URL and a verb. A request without both is incomplete.

By default, the browser issues GET requests when you type a URL into the address
bar and press `enter`. When you submit forms, the browser typically issues a
POST request.

## Make a Request

Make a request using the browser. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com). When
you clicked this link, the browser made a GET request to Google's server. We
often describe requests like this:

```txt
GET https://www.google.com/
```

If we know we're working with a particular server, we might abbreviate
it as follows. For example, if Google had API documentation that described
requests you could make to its server, that documentation might say instead:

```txt
GET /
```

In other words, API docs often only describe the URI instead of the full URL.

The response your browser receives from Google is an HTML document the browser
parses and renders. What would happen if you made the same GET request outside
of the browser?

Try this in your terminal:

```sh
curl --request GET https://www.google.com
```

What did you see?

## Responses & Resources

Servers send responses, and those responses contain resource representations.

Technically, the term "resource" refers to an abstraction that your application
uses; depending on what the application does, a resource might be a 'Car', a
'Person', a 'User', or an 'Order Cart'.

A single resource can be represented in multiple different ways by the server,
including HTML, JSON, PDF files, and images. What we really mean when we say
"resource" above is a specific representation of a resource.

You may think of resources as the documents that are returned (usually HTML or
JSON) as part of the response body.

## Response Statuses

What are HTTP status codes?

## Questions

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Define HTTP

In your own words, give a brief description of what HTTP is.

```md
HTTP are the rules for how documents on the internet move from one place to another between clients and servers.

```

## Describe what a client is and what a server is

 What is a client and what is a server? How do they interact with each other?

```md
A client is a computer that sends a request and recieves a response. Like the browser on my laptop when I am trying to go to a new website. The server is the computer that recives a request and sends out the response.
```

## Describe the 4 most common HTTP verbs

What are the 4 most common HTTP verbs used when creating a RESTful API. How
would you use each?

```md
GET, POST, PUT and DELETE are the most important.

You use GET to transmit the data from the URL to the client in a reuqest.

You use PUT when you create or update the resource identified by the URL.

You use DELETE to delete a resource identified by a URL.

You use POST to repeat a process at a URL base.

```

## Describe what a Response is

What is a response? What does it contain? What are some common status codes in a
response and what do they mean?

```md
HTTP responses tell us whether an HTTP request has been successfully completed.
There are 5 common responses that start with the following:
100 - Information responses - everything is OK and the client should continue with the request
200 - Success Responses- the request was successful
300 - Redirection responses -  the request has more than one possible response
400 - Client error responses - the server could not understand the request due to invlaid syntax
500 - Server error responses -  the server encountered an error and doesn't know how to respond

```

## Make a curl request

Using curl, how would you get the content from Reddit.com?

```md
We can make an http requestu to a server and print its response to the console. It would look like: $ curl reddit.com

I don't really understand what curl does and why or when we would use it despite reading the docs. 
```

## Describe the parts of a URL

List the parts of a URL and explain what each part is, in your own words. You'll
refer to this list often in the next few weeks, so it's important to keep it in
an easy-to-reference place.

```md
I'll go in order:
1. The protocol: which rules the browser should follow. Usually http or https
2. Domain name: the name of the specific server being requested.
3. Port: the "gate" used to access the resources on the server.
4. File path: gives us a more specific location of the web server
5. Parameters: extra key, value pairs for extra information. Not always necessary
6. Anchor: A "bookmark" that gives us the content of a specific location

I really liked the analogy of a URL being like a regular postal mail address on MDN:
protocol is the postal service you want to use, domain name is the city or town, port is the zip code, path, is the building your mail should be delivered to and parameters are the extra info, like the apartment building number. Anchor is the name of the person you want the mail to go to.
```
