## HTTP Required Reading

HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how documents are
transferred from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format
of the messages passed between *clients* and *servers*.

"Clients" send *requests* and receive *responses*. Examples include browsers
(like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and other programs like
[`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and
[`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

"Servers" receive requests and send responses. Examples are more complex, since
there are different kinds of servers. There are application servers, which work
in Node or Ruby to generate documents using those languages, and there are web
servers like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](http://nginx.com/), and
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net). The word "server" is also used to describe
the machine that these programs run on. In this document, the latter is what we
mean when we say "server", as in this diagram:

1.  A client sends a request to a server.
1.  The server processes the request.
1.  The response gets sent back to the client.
1.  The client processes the response.

## URLs

Which server is the request sent to? How does the server know what to respond
with? Both of these questions are answered by *uniform resource locator (URL)*.

Study each part of a URL using the [Mozilla Developer Network
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

## HTTP Verbs

A request has two parts: a URL and a verb. A request without both is incomplete.

By default, the browser issues GET requests when you type a URL into the address
bar and press `enter`. When you submit forms, the browser typically issues a
POST request.

## Make a Request

Make a request using the browser. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com). When
you clicked this link, the browser made a GET request to Google's server. We
often describe requests like this:

```txt
GET https://www.google.com/
```

If we know we're working with a particular server, we might shorten abbreviate
it as follows. For example, if Google had API documentation that described
requests you could make to it's server, that documentation might say instead:

```txt
GET /
```

In other words, API docs often only describe the URI instead of the full URL.

The response your browser receives from Google is an HTML document the browser
parses and renders. What would happen if you made the same get request outside
of the browser?

Try this in your terminal:

```sh
curl --request GET https://www.google.com
```

What did you see?

## Responses & Resources

Servers send responses, and those responses contain resource representations.

Technically, the term "resource" refers to an abstraction that your application
uses; depending on what the application does, a resource might be a 'Car', a
'Person', a 'User', or an 'Order Cart'.

A single resource can be represented in multiple different ways by the server,
including a HTML, JSON, PDF files, and images. What we really mean when we say
"resource" above is a specific representation of a resource.

You may think of resources as the documents that are returned (usually HTML or
JSON) as part of the response body.

## Response Statuses

## Questions

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Define HTTP

In your own words, give a breif description of what HTTP is.

```md
HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. It is a system of rules that that
defines how documents are transferred from one place to another. One thing it
does is define how clients and servers interact with each other.
```

## Describe what a client is and what a server is

 What is a client is and what is a server? How do they interact with each other?

```md
Clients are things that send requests and receive responses from those requests.
They send requests to a server and receive responses back from that server.
A client would be a web-browser like Firefox or a command-line program like cURL.
Servers are entities that receive requests and send responses. The word 'server'
is also used to describe the machine that server programs run on. There are many
different types of servers, such as application servers like Node.js, and
web-servers, like Apache.
```

## Describe the 4 most common HTTP verbs

What are the 4 most common HTTP verbs used when creating a RESTful API. How
would you use each?

```md
POST: 'Create' - Creates new resources.
GET: 'Read' - Read or retrieve a representation of a resource.
PUT: 'Update/Replace' - Most often used for update functionality, putting to a
     known resource with new data.
DELETE: 'Delete' - Used to delete a resource.
```

## Describe what a Response is

What is a response? what does it contain? What are some common status codes in a
response and what do they mean?

```md
A response is data sent back by a server after a request from a client. They
contain resource representations. Some common status codes are:
  200 OK - Everything completed successfully, depending on request will send
           either resource asked for or result of action performed.
  301 Moved Permanently - This an all future requests should be sent to new URl.
  404 Not Found - The requested resource could not be found.
  500 Internal Server Error - Generic error message given when when an unexpected
                              condition was encountered and no further data is available.
```

## Make a curl request

Using curl, how would you get the content from Reddit.com?

```md
curl -v https://www.reddit.com
```

## Describe the parts of a URL

List the parts of a URL and explain what each part is, in your own words. You'll
refer to this list often in the next few weeks, so it's important to keep it in
an easy-to-reference place.

```md
http://     www.domain.com: 1234 /path/to/resource ?a=x&b=y
protocol    host            port resource path     query
Protocol: What protocol the browser must use.
Host: Which web server is being requested.
Port: Used to indicate the gate through which to access resources on the web server.
      Usually ommitted if the server uses standard ports such as 80 for HTTP.
Resource Path: Path to the resource on the web server.
Parameters/Query: Extra parameters given to the web server, used to do extra stuff
                  before returning a resource. They are key/value pairs seperated
                  by an &.
```
