## HTTP

HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how documents are
transferred from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format
of the messages passed between *clients* and *servers*.

"Clients" send *requests* and receive *responses*. Examples include browsers
(like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and other programs like
[`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and
[`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

"Servers" receive requests and send responses. Examples are more complex, since
there are different kinds of servers. There are application servers, which work
in Node or Ruby to generate documents using those languages, and there are web
servers like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](http://nginx.com/), and
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net). The word "server" is also used to describe
the machine that these programs run on. In this document, the latter is what we
mean when we say "server", as in this diagram:

1.  A client sends a request to a server.
1.  The server processes the request.
1.  The response gets sent back to the client.
1.  The client processes the response.

## URLs

Which server is the request sent to? How does the server know what to respond
with? Both of these questions are answered by *uniform resource locator (URL)*.

## HTTP Verbs

A request has two parts: a URL and a verb. A request without both is incomplete.

By default, the browser issues GET requests when you type a URL into the address
bar and press `enter`. When you submit forms, the browser typically issues a
POST request.

## Make a Request

Make a request using the browser. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com). When
you clicked this link, the browser made a GET request to Google's server. We
often describe requests like this:

```txt
GET https://www.google.com/
```

If we know we're working with a particular server, we might shorten abbreviate
it as follows. For example, if Google had API documentation that described
requests you could make to it's server, that documentation might say instead:

```txt
GET /
```

In other words, API docs often only describe the URI instead of the full URL.

The response your browser receives from Google is an HTML document the browser
parses and renders. What would happen if you made the same get request outside
of the browser?

Try this in your terminal:

```sh
curl --request GET https://www.google.com
```

What did you see?

## Responses & Resources

Servers send responses, and those responses contain resource representations.

Technically, the term "resource" refers to an abstraction that your application
uses; depending on what the application does, a resource might be a 'Car', a
'Person', a 'User', or an 'Order Cart'.

A single resource can be represented in multiple different ways by the server,
including a HTML, JSON, PDF files, and images. What we really mean when we say
"resource" above is a specific representation of a resource.

You may think of resources as the documents that are returned (usually HTML or
JSON) as part of the response body.

## Response Statuses

What are HTTP status codes?

## Questions

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Define HTTP

In your own words, give a breif description of what HTTP is.

```md
HTTP is a protocol (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that people use to transfer
resources around on the internet. HTTP has two roles - client and server, and
the way it works is that the client sends an HTTP request and then the server
sends back a response, after some processing. The HTTP request has a header
and a body, and the server knows what to do with the content of the request
based on what verb is used in the header. The body contains content but can
also be empty. I think the key thing about HTTP is that it is just a standard
so it is agnostic toward what the client and server actually are. I think that
anything that can send a server a properly formatted HTTP request, and
receive a response, can be a client, and server can be anything that understands
the requests etc. That is why applications can work on different browsers
and devices.

I used my former knowledge and the links and videos provided above.

## Describe what a client is and what a server is

 What is a client is and what is a server? How do they interact with each other?

```md
The client, or "user agent" e.g. a web browser or cURL is the side of the
HTTP exchange that sends the request to the web server. The web server is
the application, or back end, that has the resources that the clientside
request is referring to. Technically a web server can have multiple web
applications on it, but in the description of HTTP, people often call each
application a "web server", since the important thing is that it is
"server side" rather than "client side".

I used my former knowledge and the links and videos provided above.
```

## Describe the 4 most common HTTP verbs

What are the 4 most common HTTP verbs used when creating a RESTful API. How would you use each?

```md

GET - get a resource from a web server, is idempotent (can be repeated)

POST - send data to a web server, hides it in the request body rather than
showing it in the URL (which is what GET does) - is not idempotent, it can
cause changes on the server that do not directly relate to the content being
sent i.e. it can change the state of the server so that another request would
not be interacting with the same server state.

PUT - create or replace a resource on a web server, is idempotent (can be repeated)

DELETE - delete a resource from a web server, is idempotent (can be repeated)

I used my former knowledge and the links and videos provided above. Also:
http://www.diffen.com/difference/GET_(HTTP)_vs_POST_(HTTP)
```

## Describe what a Response is

What is a response? what does it contain? What are some common status codes in a response and what do they mean?

```md
An HTTP response is what the server sends back to the client.

The response header contains a response code, which is specified in the
webserver definition, but has certain conventions. Generally,
100-199 is just waiting,
200-299 means everything is okay,
300-399 means that other action is required e.g. redirection,
400-499 means that the request had something wrong
500-599 means that server has an internal error.
The most common example is probably 404 which means that the resource was not found.

Aside from the response header, the response body will contain any requested content.

I used my former knowledge and the links and videos provided above. And:

## Make a curl request

Using curl, how would you get the content from Reddit.com?

```md
curl --request GET https://www.reddit.com/ > /Users/mishaherscu/Desktop/reddit.html

This should send the content of that page to a file on my desktop.
Unfortuntely they think I am a bot qq.
