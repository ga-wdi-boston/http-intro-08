## HTTP Required Reading

HTTP is a protocol - a system of rules - that determines how documents are
transferred from one place to another. Among other things, it defines the format
of the messages passed between *clients* and *servers*.

"Clients" send *requests* and receive *responses*. Examples include browsers
(like Chrome, Safari, or Firefox) and other programs like
[`curl`](http://curl.haxx.se/docs/) and
[`wget`](http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/manual/wget.html).

"Servers" receive requests and send responses. Examples are more complex, since
there are different kinds of servers. There are application servers, which work
in Node or Ruby to generate documents using those languages, and there are web
servers like [Apache](http://httpd.apache.org/), [nginx](http://nginx.com/), and
[lighttpd](https://www.lighttpd.net). The word "server" is also used to describe
the machine that these programs run on. In this document, the latter is what we
mean when we say "server", as in this diagram:

1.  A client sends a request to a server.
1.  The server processes the request.
1.  The response gets sent back to the client.
1.  The client processes the response.

## URLs

Which server is the request sent to? How does the server know what to respond
with? Both of these questions are answered by *uniform resource locator (URL)*.

Study each part of a URL using the [Mozilla Developer Network
Documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL).

## HTTP Verbs

A request has two parts: a URL and a verb. A request without both is incomplete.

By default, the browser issues GET requests when you type a URL into the address
bar and press `enter`. When you submit forms, the browser typically issues a
POST request.

## Make a Request

Make a request using the browser. Go to [Google](https://www.google.com). When
you clicked this link, the browser made a GET request to Google's server. We
often describe requests like this:

```txt
GET https://www.google.com/
```

If we know we're working with a particular server, we might shorten abbreviate
it as follows. For example, if Google had API documentation that described
requests you could make to it's server, that documentation might say instead:

```txt
GET /
```

In other words, API docs often only describe the URI instead of the full URL.

The response your browser receives from Google is an HTML document the browser
parses and renders. What would happen if you made the same get request outside
of the browser?

Try this in your terminal:

```sh
curl --request GET https://www.google.com
```

What did you see?

## Responses & Resources

Servers send responses, and those responses contain resource representations.

Technically, the term "resource" refers to an abstraction that your application
uses; depending on what the application does, a resource might be a 'Car', a
'Person', a 'User', or an 'Order Cart'.

A single resource can be represented in multiple different ways by the server,
including a HTML, JSON, PDF files, and images. What we really mean when we say
"resource" above is a specific representation of a resource.

You may think of resources as the documents that are returned (usually HTML or
JSON) as part of the response body.

## Response Statuses

## Questions

Use your favorite search engine and the provided readings to research and
respond to the following questions.

In your responses, be sure to cite any relevant sources you consulted in your
search. We ask you to write responses in your own words in order to see how you
process what you've read. Please do not respond with direct quotes from source
material. Instead, digest what you've read and repeat it in your own voice.

## Define HTTP

In your own words, give a breif description of what HTTP is.

```md
HTTP short for hypertext transfer protocol is an application that enables the transfer
of data from clients to servers and servers back to clients. It defines the rules of
transmitting data over the internet. Data thats being delivered can be text, images,
video, audios, etc.
```

## Describe what a client is and what a server is

 What is a client is and what is a server? How do they interact with each other?

```md
Client can be a machine or a program that have internet connection and does requests.
Server are programs only and they only duty is to listen to request. The interaction
between the two is that the clients send out requests, servers listen to requests,
server reviews the request, and sends a respond back out to the client corresponding
to the method that was used upon setting up the request. The respond can varies up a
bit depending on the result of the server's review to the request.
```

## Describe the 4 most common HTTP verbs

What are the 4 most common HTTP verbs used when creating a RESTful API. How
would you use each?

```md
The four common HTTP verbs are GET, PUT, POST, DELETE. GET is used on a regular basis
being that it is used to get resource such displaying the webpage. DELETE basically
means deleting an item or thing within the webpage. Put is used when you want to update
or change something. Lastly, POST is used when you want to create something.
```

## Describe what a Response is

What is a response? what does it contain? What are some common status codes in a
response and what do they mean?

```md
Response is what the server does when a client sends a request. Depending on the
result of the review from the server to the request and if the server can or can't
fulfill the request, the response varies. It mainly contains the contents the status
code that defines on if the server can or cannot present you with the resource that
you requested. One of the more common codes that a regular user/client would see
would be the 404 and 200 code. 404 is basically meaning the page is not found and 200
means the request can be fulfill and the server's respond succeeds in fulfilling the
client's request. There are other codes, but for now those two should be the ones that
most people would see.
```

## Make a curl request

Using curl, how would you get the content from Reddit.com?

```md
curl -i http://www.reddit.com
```

## Describe the parts of a URL

List the parts of a URL and explain what each part is, in your own words. You'll
refer to this list often in the next few weeks, so it's important to keep it in
an easy-to-reference place.

```md
Taken for example: http://google.com.uk/sdsd/dscdj
http - hypertext transfer protocol, sets the rule of client server model
google.com - domain name
.com - domain extension, varies, can be .org,.edu
.uk - geographical extension - points to location
/sdsd/dscdj - Path - same as pointing to a directory or file within your computer.
```
